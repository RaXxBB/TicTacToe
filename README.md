# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C#. The game allows a player to play against a computer opponent.

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns marking a square with their symbol (X or O).
- The first player to get 3 of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## How to Play

- When it's your turn, you will be prompted to enter a number from 1 to 9. Each number represents a position on the game board, as shown below:

    ```
       |   |   
     1 | 2 | 3 
    ___|___|___
       |   |   
     4 | 5 | 6 
    ___|___|___
       |   |   
     7 | 8 | 9 
       |   |   
    ```

- Enter the number corresponding to the position where you want to place your symbol.
- The computer will make its move automatically after you make your move.
- The game continues until either a player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Winning Tip
